# DAO Taxonomy Call 1 Summary

**Purpose:** To begin creating a framework that allows us to identify and categorize existing DAOs, so that we can derive templates for new ones to be created in a way that allows them to achieve their specific goals. To better understand the various qualities of DAOs in the ecosystem and create educational content to explain these concepts to the public.

**Existing DAO Models** (that we talked about today, by no means an exhaustive list)
- Venture DAOs: Systems that make investments according to the will of its members and distribute returns proportionally based on tokens. Regarded by the SEC as securities. Questions raised by Timothy Lewis as to the decentralized nature of a "pay to play" system.
- LLC DAOs: Legally recognized business entities such as the LAO and OpenLaw projects that can interact with "outside" business communities while protected by the law. Wyoming is the first state in the U.S. to adopt this model. Consensus on call was that while they are great for progress in public recognition/understanding, they are extremely limited in what they can actually do.
- Non-Profit DAOs: This is the DevxDAO model, where profit is not an incentive. The function is to distribute value via grants to applicants as determined by a governance system. DxD uses reputation-staking as the voting mechanism and a milestone framework to add voting members/continue grants. This is the ideal model for organizations that do not need to raise money and wish to give grants in a community-driven fashion. Also legally wrapped. 

**Organizations that could adopt the DxD model**

We talked for a time about how various organizations could use the DxD governance system to better run their resource distribution. As mentioned earlier, we agreed that this works best for groups that are not trying to make a profit, however Wulf Kaal mentioned a variant "Founder" Model that could work for traditional businesses as well.

- 501cs: Pre-existing NPOs that are interested in making the transition from a hierarchical structure to a DAO could do so easily following the DxD model. This is advantageous for the "cause" that they are benefitting as the community of activists and supporters would be placed in charge of operations and spending.

- Co-ops: Companies that are collectively owned and operated by all employees seem like a natural stepping stone into for-profit models as a protocol could be created for how to share profit. It could be according to reputation within the voting system, or could be proposed to be reinvested into the business. Many co-ops struggle with coming up with an equitable and meritocratic voting system and would benefit from our model.

- "Founder" Model: proposed by Wulf and would need its own discussion to fully flesh out, the basic idea is that you could create two tokenized economies: one for the investors and an operational one in which the founder always has 50% reputation. The founder doesn't always have to vote, but will always control those resources so that they can sway things their way. The problem this solves is investors being worried about a "weak" founder who wouldn't be able to control his business.

**Potential Issues**
- Nobody can stop people from selling their reputation. Example: Timothy could work really hard and wisely use his expertise to accrue lots of reputation and sell it to Nick who does not have the same skill set. The ***hypothetical*** problem could be resolved as Nick uses his newly-purchased reputation poorly and eventually loses it. Or he could hold on to the amount he purchased, which will proportionally become less as the rest of the tide rises.

- What happens to reputation when somebody wants out? Say they decide to go completely off the grid, or at least out of the DAO ecosystem and not interface with the DAO ever again? Do we still pay out their share if they are not contributing? The proposed solutions were 1) create an inactivity trigger where an account gets frozen and potentially banned if it doesn't vote over x amount of time, or misses x amount of consecutive votes, 2) cull the bottom 5% or so of accounts every quarter, or 3) let the reputation stay and allow its size and relative influence to wither away over time. The third option was determined to be the most fair and is the one currently in place,

**Questions**

We ran out of time but had a little at the end to field some general questions. The strength of this discussion was that it had an even balance of experts and newbies and allowed a useful space to zoom out.

- Is "reputation" the best word? Wulf agreed that it is not great and has certain connotations, but insisted that it is the only term adequate as the alternatives have either worse connotations or more confusing interpretations. 
- Is there a better term out there than DAO, for that matter? Maybe; Timothy said the key to figuring this out will be to think and deliberate on the interpretations of each word in the DAO acronym.
- As we work to transition existing organizations into DAOs, at what point is it no longer a centralized organization and becomes a DAO? Is this a sliding scale? Wulf said that a group can slowly transition and in fact never make it officially known. Some groups will avoid slapping the "DAO" label on, but actually be a DAO. Ended the call on a cheerful note that anything bringing in information and representation from disenfranchised constituents is achieving the work of a DAO :)
